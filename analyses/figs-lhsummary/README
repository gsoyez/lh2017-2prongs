This folder contains the figures prepared for the LH summary talk


The files we want are as follows:

 v shape distribution for dijets(dashed) and WW(solid), parton (red) and truth (blue)
   we'll show one performant and one resilient

 v ROC curves for dijets v. WW, parton (red) and truth (blue)
   we'll show one performant and one resilient

 v a quality plot with just the 2 above points

 v a quality plot with just the 2 above lines including pt scan

 v a nightmare plot with all observables and grooming levels [global-scan.pdf]

 v for each of the 8 shape (1 per page), a scan over the grooming strategies
   use: trimmed (ATLAS)
        tpp     (CMS)
        tlt     (dichroic)
        lll     (higher eps_S)
        ttt     (resilient but not perf)
        tpp     (perf but not resilient)

 v for each of the 11 grooming strategies (1 per page), a scan over shapes


Defaults: pt=1000, R=0.8
